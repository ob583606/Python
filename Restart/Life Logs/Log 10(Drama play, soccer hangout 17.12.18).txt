				Drama showing, Bass lesson, Soccer celebration				17/12/18

	Woke up today tired as dick. Had a shower and then changed and went to school. Talked to Kai and he said he's doing the best he's
been in weeks. Also told me he was gonna buy a juul. Went to French and had an uneventful class, like always. Went to advisory and watched
Elf and ate food. Had a chill block in I.T. and then had another chill block for socials. When the lunch bell rung I had to go to the black box and 
get changed into my costume so we could do our play for middle school kids. It went better than the other two, but Oh Christmas Tree was
pretty bad. Went to dq with everyone after school, then over to Save on. Went and got my bike with Kai, then said bye to Zofia and Elzbea.
Stille into Zofia, although I don't know if I should try to date her, cuz it might be awkward if she says no, and if we break up the group is really
split. I don't know if I like Samara, but I'm pretty sure I don't. I'm gonna ask out Zofia, it'll probably end up fine. Said bye to Kai for three weeks,
then went home and couldn't find the emergency key. Had to go over to the office and pick up a home key. Made dinner and played a lil bass to
warm up for my lesson. Got ready for my lesson and went over. Mark got a new 1952 Telecaster copy made by some famous guitar maker.
Went home, had a nice poop, then went to the Tartan Toque for the soccer celebration. Throat started to hurt and I didn't feel so great, went
home and felt better. Worked on an english presentation for a while, then caught up on the logs. Going to sleep now, goodnight. Pretty ok day
today btw.
