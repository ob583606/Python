					First log, not even backstory				8/12/18

	Woke up feeling pretty icky. Watched the YouTube rewind video, really trash. Went upstairs, mom tells me I'm being forced to go to 
Butchart gardens tonight even though I have plans to sleepover at Charlie's. Quite angry at her for a while, I cleaned my room and got ready for 
soccer. Then she told me I didn't have to go and I was overjoyed.
	Went to soccer, saw Kaia while warming up, she looked really uncomfortable, it was hilarious. It was cold as balls, I felt like I did a 
really good job and deserved player of the game, didn't get it. Had cupcakes from Beau and doughnuts from Elliot though.
	Got ready to go out to meet Charlie and Mark. Met at Save On and Kai never showed up. went to DQ and then back to Charlie's.
Chilled for a while, almost had to go home because I forgot dishes and Dougie-doo was mad. Talked to Jay, went out to the garage and Charlie
weeded. Went back in and chilled for another while. Jay texts Charlie and we went and met him on Oak Bay Ave. Went to the garage and 
chilled for a bit, didn't let charlie have the bac. Went inside, Jay came in and we talked for a while then him and I made mozzarella sticks. 
After the sticks he left, we went to sleep. Good day.
