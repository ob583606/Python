						Drama rehearsal					16/12/18

	Woke up at Charlie's when the power came back on and just chilled on my phone for a bit. When Charlie woke up we talked and
stuffs, then had breakfast. After chilling for another little bit we walked over to my house, and we stopped at Fairways, Dominos and Villages on
the way. I applied online for a job as an ebike delivery boy for Dominos. Went over to the office, cleaned, then hung out for a lil bit then went to
the drama rehearsal. This time it went smoother, but still not that great. After that I went home. Pretty boring day.
