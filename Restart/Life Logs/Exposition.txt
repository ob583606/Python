A little bit of backstory of the last couple of months. 
June: Kaia and I break up. Next night Mom gets really drunk and talks about how she's mot happy in her marriage, how it's been going on for 
years and so on. Liam doesn't remember me cuz of instagram username, then says "oh lol" when I tell him it's Ollie. All in all not a fun time.
Decided to take after mother and have some vodka and gin. Went to beach, developed more of a crush on Samara, hung out with Kai for
the first actual time. Gets more drunk the next time, one week later right before getting report card. Woo mee being smart. Samara turns me
down.
July: Full out telling parents I hate them. Seriously depressed. Leave for camp. Have an amazing time at camp, come back feeling so great and
not depressed! 
August: A lot of video games and chilling with camp friends and school friends.
September: Buys bass from Chris Gilpin for birthday. School rolls back in, I'm sad that I have so litle classes with friends. Nearing the end, I
start to develop a crush on Zofia.
October: Learns that kai has a crush on Zofia as well, tries to surpress feelings. Mark is starting to be an annoying bitch. Have a good amount
of friends in my classes, everything going pretty good.
November: Parents talk about not being happy with the whole family, finds out I'm failing science. Still big crush on Zofia, but now Cade hates
me. Mark is really an annoying bitch.
December: Cade isn't hating me anymore! Went from a 46 to an 83 in science! 87% average! lots of a's, couple of b's.
