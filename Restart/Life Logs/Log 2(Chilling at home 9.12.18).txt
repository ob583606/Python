						Second log, lazy Sunday				9/12/18

	Woke up at Charlie's. I had to be home at 11 am becuase of the deal we made the day before about the dishes and the van washes.
Had a nice breakfast, got a drive home from Jim. I did the dishes, then proceeded to do nothing all day. A little bass, a little How I Met Your
Mother. Moved a green loveseat upstairs. All the Christmas decorations are up! Had dinner, Ice Cream, finished a lil socials, converted my one 
journal entry from paper to computer. About to sleep, good night. HARD DRIVE IS BROKEN AHHHHHHH THIS IS THE WORST 320
GIGABYTES OF MOVIES, TV SHOWS AND OTHER GONE. GGGGGGOOOOOONNNNNNEEEEEE!!!!!! Ok so I looked it up and there's still 
hope. I got the name of the drive back, and I can view the files from a program called EaseUp or something. I started a bitlocker encryption then 
cancelled it, so it might be that. Started and actual Bitlocker encryption now, I hope it works.
