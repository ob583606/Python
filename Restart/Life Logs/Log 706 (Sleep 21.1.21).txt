	I have been doing my new slep schedule and it works, with enough coffee. It is fairly easy to start hallucinating. I just stare at something and my vision unfocuses, and things kinda shift around. I'll also see little flashes or
whatever out of the corner of my eye. I slept Monday night after the battery spark incident, woke up for like 10:30 Tuesday. Stayed awake tuesday night, through wednesday, (Had a lil mini two min nap in english by accident) and now here
we are on a thursday. it's been over 36 hours since I've slept. 38 I think. I'm going to sleep for 7.5, then maybe have a nice long sleep friday night, and get ready to do it again next week ahaha.
