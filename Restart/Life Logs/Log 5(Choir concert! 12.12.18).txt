						Choir concert				12/12/18

	I'm writing this one a day late so I'm not sure on what happened during the day. The earliest I remember was leaving english to go to
a dentist appointment. I got picked up by Dad and Nathan then went over to Margaret Jenkins to pick Abby up. We then drove twenty minutes to
get to the dentist's office. Nathan went first, then Abby, then me. I nearly fell asleep in the waiting room, and again on the super comfy dentist
chair. My teeth are still perfect! Went home, chilled for a bit, made a hot dog with Nathan cuz apparently he can't microwave with supervision.
Watched some himym, then got changed into dress pants and shoes, went over to the school and got my choir dress shirt. Went on stage and
practiced a song or two, then sat in the audience till hallelujah chorus. Chilled during intermission, and sat for another little while till men's choir
came up and sang. We did Frobisher Bay and Feliz Navidad. There was an encore for the 12 days of Christmas chamber choir or something
did, which was fucking hilarious. (Shaemus and Owen doing the dehdehdehdehdehdehdeh, Ken (I think) doing the high-pitched FIVE GOLDEN
RIIIINGS) I hung out with Charlie after, and we went to dq. Got a blizzard courtesy of Jim, then went back to the school and fucked around for a
bit. Charlie got a drive, then I got a drive. Watched some himym, drank some soup, and had a niceish sleep. Thought people were in my bed
at times, but other than that it was good. Good day.
