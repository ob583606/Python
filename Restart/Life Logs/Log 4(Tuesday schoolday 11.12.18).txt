						Rainy tuesday				11/12/18

	Today I woke up and then instantly fell asleep again. Then I actually got up and got ready for school. Biked to school in the pouring
rain and had a chill drama block. Went to a choir rehearsal for the concert tomorrow for focus, then went to Shrubsole for the rest. Nothing
eventful happened, and I went to english right after. Carson and I found the Leapfrog letter factory movie, and I remembered that there was a 
scary part in it. He kept pushing me to tell him what part it was but I couldn't remember. Went to science, did a lab, then went to cafeteria for
lunch. I went to Elzbea's house with her and Zofia in the torrential downpour, then went over to Save on. They got cookies for jazz choir or 
something. Went to french and nearly died of boredom, then straight to I.T. I'm already done my car game in gamemaker so I chilled for the
entire class then left a couple minutes early to meet Charlie, who had been skipping and was high. Chilled at his house, ate Kraft Dinner and
watched tv, had some wagon wheels, the usual. Got a drive home from mom, then checked my hard drive. Although I had finished the Bitlocker
encryption, it still wasn't working. I got called up for dinner, so I went and ate tacos. After that I did the chickens, and went to work on my hard 
drive again. I managed to be able to view the files and copy stuff to and from the drive. I could do everfything I wanted to, but it was annoying to
get to the stuff. I ended up going outside to play Black Ops 4's DLC 1 that had just been released, but it needed to download so I just talked to 
Sudsy and Jazzy. Went back inside after they both left, and worked on the hard drive a little more. Dad came in and I was showing him what I 
had been doing when all of a sudden it started working!!! I'm so happy that it's fixed, and I'm copying it all onto the cloud drive. I have to go to 
bed now, it has been a very good day.
