	So nothing much is happening, just wanted to talk about life real quick. Me and Zofia still going strong, school is going fine, life is
good. I still think Kathleen is the prettiest girl i have ever met irl, Zofia is prettiest in our grade. I have also realized that Shmalexandra is a very
dateable person, if things between me and zof don't end up working out or something I feel like I'm gonna fall in love with Alex. I don't think it
work because she's too close to me and Zofia but you never know where life will take you. Also I would never risk losing my relationship as it is
to date anyone else, I love Zofia too much. We've been dating for over 6 months now, I want to see how she feels about moving forward and
downwards to the vagajinag area. Not sure when I will or how I'm gonna go about it, but hopefully soon. Gonna go see monster trucks soon!!
Super excited for that. Also I got my Bronze cross and medallion and shit over winter break and I've applied to camp, I can't wait for summer but
I'll miss all my friends. Yeah! Not much has happened in the past while. Keedokee, update you later. Goodnight and goodbye.
