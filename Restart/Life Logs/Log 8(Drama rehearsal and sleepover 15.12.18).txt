					Big drama rehearsal and sleepover with charlie			15/12/18
	
	I woke up and had a shower, then went to the drama dress rehearsal. We just went through it a couple times, and it was rough.
Charlie came after and picked me up, and we went to my house. After doing a little cleaning we got a drive to Charlie's and hung out there. I
convinced parentals to let me sleepover, and then the power went out at 10:30. Jay joined us for a chill in the garage and a walk to the beach.(I
smoked a bunch of pine needles from his bong and it hurt like a son of a bitch.) We then lit some candles and just hung out till we fell asleep. 
Good day.
