## for scientific notation, you do numberEnumber. 2E0 is 2 (2*10^0). 2E3 is 8.

a = 5E6
print(a)

## to do complex numbers you do real part + complex part, but the complex part uses a j instead of an i. you NEED a coefficient in front.
## 1 + j doesn't make sense, but 1 + 1j does.

C = 1+1j
print (C)

## find the position of a free falling object

from scipy.constants import g
print (g)
